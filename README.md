# The Gaming Room

<h3>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</h3>

Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) wants to develop a web-page game that serves multiple platforms. These platforms are based on their current game, “Draw It or Lose It” and is currently only available on Android app. The client requested this game to be able to have one or more teams involved and every team will have multiple players assigned to it. The game and the team names must be unique. Finally, there can only exists only one instance of the game in the memory at a given time.  Since the staff at The Gaming Room don’t know how to set up the environment, I will need to help them with this, and any software struggles they are having. I will have to approach every task the client has asked and approach these tasks by most important to least important. The most important tasks I will have to spend more time on them. Once the client gives me the total budget and deadline of the project, I will have a better understanding on how I will be approaching these tasks. The higher the budget and longer the deadline, the more in depth I will be able to go into the project.
