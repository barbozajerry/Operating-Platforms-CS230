# The Gaming Room

<h3>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</h3>

Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) wants to develop a web-page game that serves multiple platforms. These platforms are based on their current game, “Draw It or Lose It” and is currently only available on Android app. The client requested this game to be able to have one or more teams involved and every team will have multiple players assigned to it. The game and the team names must be unique. Finally, there can only exists only one instance of the game in the memory at a given time.  Since the staff at The Gaming Room don’t know how to set up the environment, I will need to help them with this, and any software struggles they are having. I will have to approach every task the client has asked and approach these tasks by most important to least important. The most important tasks I will have to spend more time on them. Once the client gives me the total budget and deadline of the project, I will have a better understanding on how I will be approaching these tasks. The higher the budget and longer the deadline, the more in depth I will be able to go into the project.  


<h3>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</h3>

What I did well in developing this docuemnt was doing enough reserach about Operating Systems Architecture, Storage Management, Memory Management, Distributed Systems and Networks, Security and the pros and cons of Mac, Linux, Windows and Mobile Devices.

<h3>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</h3>

I found it very helpful working thourgh the design doscuemnt when developing the code since it the design document made me underdstand this project better, making it easier to develope the code. 

<h3>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</h3>

I would probably to even more research on these topics and just add more information to the project. 


<h3>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</h3> 

First I had to really understand the user's needs and then do research so I can approach these needs. 

<h3>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</h3>

The software design template helped understand on what had to be done and what things I should do the most research on to understand the optimal solution to this project. This also helped me to be able to communicate it effectively to a client and development team members.
